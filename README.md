Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock is an expansion of the classic selection method game rock-paper-scissors. 
It operates on the same basic principle, but includes two additional weapons: the lizard and Spock (formed by the Star Trek Vulcan salute).
This reduces the chances of a round ending in a tie (from 1/3 to 1/5).

Computer rather picking randomly, it uses frequency analysis, the program simply identifies the most frequently played move by the user and picks a counter move.
